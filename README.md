# D3-Challenge
The challenge is to provide an interactive chart that allows the user to see each state, and the data from each state in regards to age, income, poverty, smoking, healthcare and obesity. The tool will help users, determine where some deficits lay, and perhaps how to make the bigger impact.
To get the chart working, I incorporated html, javascript and the d3 tool which allows the user to interact with the chart.
